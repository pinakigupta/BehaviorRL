    "Reinforcement Learning Baselines (from OpenAI) applied to Autonomous Driving\n",
    "\n",
    "This Research is aiming to address RL approaches to solve Urban driving scenarios such as (but not limited ): Roundabout, Merging, Urban/Street navigation, Two way navigation (pass over the opposite direction lane), self parking, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to compare performances of well known RL algorithms (from Open AI baselines) in these environments and use these results as a foundation for further studies of the potencial use of RL for AD at production level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research will also address the differences (advantages and disadvantages) between Continuous and Discrete Action Spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Original version of these environments were created by **Edouard Leurent** and can be found in https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents are not primed yet but getting better. Here is one sample from a challenging two-way environment, where the HV has to negotiate same direction as well as oncoming traffic. In addition\n",
    "to the moving traffic there are parked cars in both lanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/PPO2.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Latest update is I am trying to use previously trained agents to simulate the dynamic traffic. The host and ther other agents are not trained in this sort of multiagent environment yet, This \n",
    "is just pure single agent prediction in multi-agent environment. Hence the performance may not seem great, but will still go on to show how well it generalizes. The next few obvious steps are\n",
    "A) Training HV agent in multi agent framework (with other agents being static policies)\n",
    "B) Self play\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/MultiAgentPPO2.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another environment I have started working on is a parking lot env. This is quite different than the structured environment(s). Please see the architecture difference between them as depicted by the flow diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "![RLarchitecture](img/RLarchitecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parking lot env is a goal oriented env, with virtual vehicles constraining the lot borders. The action space is continuous steering and  acceleration commands, while the observation space involves \n",
    "{ \"desired goals\", \"constraints\" , \"observed vehicles\"}. Currently I don't have any other vehicles as part of this environment. Currently only one goal spot is selected (marked as white) . The agent can only see N (=10) closest vehicles (marked as green). There might be additional parked vehicles in the lot that it can't see (marked as grey).\n",

    "There is a recent update where I have started using LGSVL simulator (https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/autoware-instructions/) for  more realistic environment. Right now the simulator is just being used for playback, while the pygame env is used for both training and playback. \n",
